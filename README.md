Introduction

Our project is a framework for 
1. Any user to lodge a complaint with the relevant Municipal officials, using multimedia content such as video, audio, images 
2. Officials to read, observe the various complaints of the citizens 3. Officials to forward the relevant complaints to the higher officials if needed

Usage

1. There are two modules, one for the client (citizen) and the one for the official
2. The client module allows the client to lodge a complaint
3. The complaint can have text, images, video or audio
4. The official module allows the official to view a list of all the relevant complaints
5. The officials are in various levels of power.
6. First the complaint is assigned to the lowest level.
7. Then, if needed, it proceeds to higher levels.
8. If the complaint is false or irrelevant, the official can reject it
